# Docker Bootcamp 3

This repository contains container image definitions for the Docker Bootcamp session
on container networking.

It consists of a simple chat API and application allowing users to send/receive chat
messages with a central server from multiple application instances. This is intended
to illustrate Docker networking concepts and is not a good reference architecture
for a chat application!
